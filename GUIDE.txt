In this document we will remember how use the application. 
Findd allows to find duplicate files in a specified folder. For doing there are two phases :
-> the first one consisted in indexing file from the folder specified by the user. The result could be saved.
-> the second one consisted in find duplicates from the past operation results, or from a scan backup.  

1 - Findd is a command line program, so to using this application, open a terminal and
    type "./findd".

2 - This command could not be used alone. It needs a couple of options to works, like this

    $> ./findd <option recursive scan> FOLDER_NAME <option save a scan> || <option precised saved scan > <options about filters>     
    

    <option recursive scan> 	  : -r  			make a recursive scan, so all folders underlying will be also visited 
    <option save a scan>    	  : --out-scan="file.txt"       saved the scan into "file.txt"  
    <option precised saved scan > : - i backupFile.txt          to find duplicates from a past scan saved in a file "backupFile.txt"
    <options about filters>       : -N || -S || -C              filters which define what is a duplicate for the user.
  				  				-> N : files with the same name
								-> S : files with the same size	 
								-> C : files with the same content
	


    It is important to notice that we can not used all these parameter in the same time. 
    Some ways to use the program:

    2.1 Scan + find duplicates "in one time" : $> ./findd <option recursive> FOLDER_NAME <options about filter>  
     		Example : $> ./findd -r /home -N


    2.2 Make only a scan, saved into a file : $> ./findd <option recursive> FOLDER_NAME <option save a scan>
		Example : $> ./findd ­r /home –out­scan=“scan.txt”  
   	

    2.3 Find duplicates from a file : $> ./findd <option precised saved scan> <options about filter>
		Example : $> ./findd ­i existedFile.txt ­-NS 
  

If you need more information about options, you could refer you to the application man. 
$> man findd
